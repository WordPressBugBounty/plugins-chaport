### GETTING STARTED WITH CHAPORT LIVE CHAT & CHATBOTS

To start using Chaport Live Chat, you need to create an account. It is fast and free, with no credit card required. Once your account is activated, you can install the chat widget on your website. The installation of the WordPress plugin takes only a moment.

After installation, the live chat widget will appear on your website, and you’ll be ready to communicate with your visitors. In your account, you can configure live chat settings — add operators, upload photos, customize the widget, create auto-invitations, build chatbots, and use all the available tools to enhance your customer experience.

### USE ONE ACCOUNT FOR MULTIPLE WEBSITES

You can install the Chaport chat widget on as many websites as you need on any plan, including the Free plan. Manage all your live chats in a single Chaport app. The website from which a chat originates is shown in the Visitor Info section. You can keep a consistent widget design across your sites or customize the appearance for each URL individually.

### MANAGING THE ACCOUNT

You can assign roles to your operators and specify their permissions. An operator can have one of two roles:

- **Operator** — receives live chats, sees other operators’ chats, and views reports.
- **Administrator** — has all Operator permissions plus access to account settings (customizing the widget, adding operators, etc.).

The user who first registers a Chaport account automatically becomes the **Administrator** and **Account Owner**. This user cannot be deleted, and their role always remains the same. The account owner can choose a pricing plan and manage billing.

### LIVE CHAT & CHATBOTS

Boost your website’s productivity using the combination of live chat and chatbots. Communicate with visitors in real time and provide 24/7 support through automated replies.

Chaport includes a simple, fully functional chatbot builder. Creating a chatbot is easy — no coding required. Add a new bot, define the triggers, and build the scenario.

With Chaport bots, you can provide information, answer questions, request visitor details, or transfer the conversation to a live chat operator when needed.
